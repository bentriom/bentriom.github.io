<p align="left"> Hello! I'm Mahmoud Bentriou, and I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher at the MICS lab of CentraleSup√©lec. </p>

<p align="justify"> I graduated with a PhD and an engineering degree. My scientific career history is motivated by the interactions between mathematics and computer science, with a specialization in data science (statistics, machine learning). My interests are balanced between software engineering and statistical learning methods with applications on biological data. </p>
