        - Epidemiology of radiations team, CESP, Institut Gustave Roussy
        - Biomathematics team, MICS Lab, CentraleSupélec, Université Paris-Saclay
        - "<em>Subject</em>: Survival analysis of second diseases lately induced by radiotherapy among childhood cancer survivors."
        - "<em>Details</em>: Postdoctoral researcher. My work is focused on the risk estimation of second diseases lately induced by radiotherapy among childhood cancer survivors. I develop survival analysis techniques (machine and deep learning models on censored data) based on the dose distribution of radiotherapy treatments. The dose distributions are described for the whole body of any patient at a voxel scale and are analyzed as 3D images."
